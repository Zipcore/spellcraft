# Mod economy
Give your ideas on how we can design healthy economy of the mod. The main concern is how do we introduce currency.

## Currency Farm
- Player kill
- Player assist
- Bomb plant
- Bomb defusal
- Hostage rescue
- Level up

## Currency Sink
- Leveling up spells // Combine same-type orbs together to make stronger ones which in turn make stronger spells. Gives you something to do with spare orbs.
- Reset spell slots
- Buy more character slots (?)
- Auction tax (?)
