# Ideas on how to balance orbs
*Problem: it shall be easy enough to find orbs for new players to make their first items, but also difficult enough for people to keep leveling them up fast*

Below are some separate solutions aimed to balance this out.

## Hero levels like in warcraft / lol / dota
* That is, person needs to be level 7 to have at least a single spell of a rank 4, if he wants rank 5 , then level 9 is needed.
* Each Spell Rank also consumes one level-up given by a hero's level.
* leveling up gets hard enormously fast, like in 1.0 wowmod, that is leveling up to level 20 is about +150%  as hard as to level 19

## Give out free orbs to new players
* First few levels are quick, thus beginners need around 9 orbs in first hour, that is too much for drop system to support. We can instead just give out like 3 random orbs each level up they make.
* To prevent farming and selling, let new players be able to sell on the market once they get to Level 7.

## Balance high levels
* From level 19 to level 20 it will ake several days or more, person will be able to farm 10 or more orbs during that time, thus it won't be a problem to find a combo of 3.. That is a problem
* Solution: To level up spell from Rank 3 to Rank 4, person will need that combo x4 times. Example frostbolt: 4x Fire 4x Frost 4x Frost.
