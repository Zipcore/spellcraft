# Spellcraft Menus
Simplicity is the ultimate objective. Using up all the space for information is also desired, but not to overload!

## Main
* Title: Archmage Level 9 (23123)  -  Archmage is a dynamically given name based on the skills they chosen. 23123 is player Id
* Hero Menu (X level ups)  -  X Level ups tells whwether they have 'points' from levels to  level-up spells or learn new. It does not imply whehter they have enough orbs though
* Backpack (X New)   -  managing a tiny inventory they have as well as selling. X new - tells how many new items were receive, for instance if 5 orbs, it'll tell 5 New.. Lter person will be able to open Notifications and see in detailed when and how he received (from someone, from selling, or from drops?)
* Premium   -  a placeholder for future
* Other Players  -  Look at other players currently online, can also contain a link to scoreboard if there will be demand.
* Help  - Menu, where people will be able to find the info on the mod, and mainly a list of possible spells and how to combine.

Notice that (X aaa) will not be displayed if X is 0, to prevent overload with information

## Hero Menu

* 1. Frost Bolt (X)   -  X tells the level of a spell. Clickable

## Spell Menu
Granted person clicked on one of the spells, there will be two options. One if it was a spell, and 2nd if it was empty slot.

### Option #1
* Title: Frost Bolt (X)
* Level-up (tell here why he can't if he can't)   - Examples of why he can't: "required X hero level"; "no level-ups"; "not enough orbs".
Let it be still clickable, the next menu will in details explain why he can't, like list all the needed orbs, and how many he has.
Level-up menu shall also tell what is the next strength of a rank
* Information on the spell. Brief info, as well as how strong it is on this rank
* Unlearn button, with Confirms of course like in wowmod.

### Option #2
* Title: Spell #X  - X tells what is the slot
* Learn new spell:
* Select Orb  - This and next two entries allow person to tell which orb to use. Select Orb is default, then person can click on it and choose the orb he wants to use. He can chose the ones which he doesn't have to see what it combines into, though he won't be allowed to make spell without orbs of course.
* Fire x0
* Frost x1
* Combine into Frostbolt  -  Moves to next menu describing the spell, telling the Spell Slot again, and then Confirm button.
